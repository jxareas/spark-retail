<b><i>Spark Retail Group Project</i></b>
</h1>
</div>

This project aims to analyze and solve a series of tasks related to the retail sector using Apache Spark 2.x with
Python. 

The analysis involves processing and analyzing purchase data and stock data to gain insights into product sales,
revenue generation, geographic trends, and inventory management.

The data is provided in two formats:

1. **Purchases:** A `purchases.json` file containing daily purchases made worldwide.
2. **Stock:** A `stock.csv` file containing stock levels for each product.
